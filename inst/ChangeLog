--- Switched to using NEWS instead of ChangeLog ---

use SuperLearnerNews() to see changes (will open the NEWS file)


2010-04-05:
- added summary.CV.SuperLearner
- added obsWeights to some of the prediction algorithms
- Switch from ChangeLog to NEWS and added SuperLearnerNews()

2010-03-30:
- implemented observation weights in loss functions.  Weights must be known a priori, they are not estimated in the SuperLearner.
- changed NNLS to use the solve.QP instead of nnls (since we added the weights)
- both NNLS and NNloglik now use the weights argument.
- the name of the optimization functions has changed to be internal functions.  .NNLS() and .NNloglik()

2010-02-28:
- added screen.glmnet()

2010-02-23:
- fixed splits with id in CV.SuperLearner

2010-02-22:
- added screen.corP() and screen.corRank()
- adapted .listPvalueGLM() to use cor.test() if family = gaussian to increase speed

2010-02-17:
- added print and coef methods for CV.SuperLearner

2010-02-08:
- added control.rpart() to the SL.bagging wrapper

2010-01-21:
- added SL.bagTree

2010-01-20:
- added SL.bagging and SL.loess

2009-12-07:
